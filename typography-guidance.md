# Typography Guidance Plan

Excellent choice. Montserrat and Open Sans are a robust and popular combination that will serve you well across all your platforms.

Here is a complete typography guidance plan for your website, web app, and iOS app.

### 1. Do you need more fonts?

**No.** Two fonts are ideal. Using just Montserrat and Open Sans will ensure your brand looks consistent, professional, and clean across your entire digital presence. It's a versatile combination that can handle all your typographic needs.

### 2. Font Usage Guide

Here is a clear breakdown of where to use each font to create a consistent and easy-to-read hierarchy:

**Montserrat** (The "display" font)
Use for text that needs to make an impact and grab attention.

*   **When to use:**
    *   **Logos:** "Mealie.ai"
    *   **Main Headings (H1):** The main title on a page (e.g., "Meal planning made easy").
    *   **Section Headings (H2, H3):** Titles for different sections of your website or app (e.g., "Smart Recipe Management").
    *   **Card Titles:** The name of a recipe or meal plan in a card.
    *   **Key Numbers or Stats:** Any important numbers you want to highlight.

*   **Recommended Weights:**
    *   `700` (Bold) for most headings.
    *   `600` (Semi-bold) for sub-headings.

**Open Sans** (The "workhorse" font)
Use for all other text where readability is the top priority.

*   **When to use:**
    *   **Body Text:** All paragraphs and descriptions.
    *   **UI Elements:** Buttons, navigation links, input field labels, and menus.
    *   **Lists:** Ingredient lists, feature lists, etc.
    *   **Captions & Helper Text:** Any smaller, secondary text.

*   **Recommended Weights:**
    *   `400` (Regular) for all body text.
    *   `600` (Semi-bold) or `700` (Bold) for emphasis within body text or for button text.

### 3. Typographic Sizing System

This system provides a harmonious and consistent scale for your font sizes. It's based on a standard `16px` body size.

| Element         | Font         | Weight    | Size (Web) | Notes                                      |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **H1**          | Montserrat   | 700 (Bold)  | `40px`     | Main page title. Use sparingly (once per page). |
| **H2**          | Montserrat   | 700 (Bold)  | `32px`     | Major section headings.                    |
| **H3**          | Montserrat   | 600 (Semi-bold) | `25px`     | Sub-headings.                              |
| **H4**          | Montserrat   | 600 (Semi-bold) | `20px`     | Minor headings or card titles.             |
| **Body**        | Open Sans    | 400 (Regular) | `16px`     | The default size for all paragraph text.   |
| **Small Body**  | Open Sans    | 400 (Regular) | `14px`     | For UI elements like buttons and labels.   |
| **Caption**     | Open Sans    | 400 (Regular) | `13px`     | For helper text or secondary information.  |

### iOS App Specific Guidance

For the iOS app, you should follow the same principles but map them to Apple's native text styles. This ensures your app will feel at home on the platform and will support features like Dynamic Type (which lets users change their preferred text size).

*   Use **Montserrat** for the `Large Title`, `Title 1`, `Title 2`, and `Title 3` styles.
*   Use **Open Sans** for the `Headline`, `Body`, `Callout`, `Subhead`, `Footnote`, and `Caption` styles.

This plan will give your brand a strong, consistent, and professional typographic identity.
